The purpose of making this project is to use the maximum attributes which is available in getbootstrap.com. And some hands on experience how a bootstrap work.
Learning bootstrap in theoritical is different think but making a pages with the help of bootstrap is different experience.
In this project I have made a nav bar, dropdown, searchbar, login and sign-up, cards, carousel, button and footer inside my index.html folder.
And if I am talking about my "About" section of my project so inside my about section there is three different cards attach to it.
And if you have any query related to my website so there is contact us option also there inside it there is a validation and query related.
So yeah I have a made this all thinks with the help of bootstrap only.
